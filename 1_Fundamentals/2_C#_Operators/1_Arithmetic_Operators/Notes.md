These are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. The Binary Operators falling in this category are :

    Addition: The ‘+’ operator adds two operands. For example, x+y.
    Subtraction: The ‘-‘ operator subtracts two operands. For example, x-y.
    Multiplication: The ‘*’ operator multiplies two operands. For example, x*y.
    Division: The ‘/’ operator divides the first operand by the second. For example, x/y.
    Modulus: The ‘%’ operator returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second. For example, x%y.
