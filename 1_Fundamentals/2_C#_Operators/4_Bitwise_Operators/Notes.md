In C#, there are 6 bitwise operators which work at bit level or used to perform bit by bit operations. Following are the bitwise operators :

    & (bitwise AND) Takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.

    | (bitwise OR) Takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 any of the two bits is 1.

    ^ (bitwise XOR) Takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.

    << (left shift) Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

    >> (right shift) Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
